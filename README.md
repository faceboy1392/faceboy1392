# About me
Hello! I'm a teenager who enjoys video games and programming.

### Interests
- Video games
- Programming
- Building computers
- Neat machines

### Other stuff

My main project currently is a work-in-progress [Discord bot](https://github.com/faceboy1392/bob-stuff#readme). It's nothing crazy, but it is designed to be a good option for a multipurpose server bot that always keeps a smile on his low-resolution face.

There isn't too much else to know about me, besides the fact that I am quite good at annoying people.
